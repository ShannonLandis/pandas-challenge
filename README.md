 Python Module 4 Challenge

 January 2024

 Run Jupyter Notebook PyCitySchools_Slandis.ipynb to analyze the schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv found in the resources folder.

 The code will merge the two sets of data into one and analyze math, reading, and overall passing rates per school.  
 Other metrics measured will be per student budget, student body size by school, and performance by school type.

 A report of findings based on this analysis is titled "Module 4 Written Report SLandis.docx" and is located in the PyCitySchools folder.
